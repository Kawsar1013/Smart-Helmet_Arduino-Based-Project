**Project Name:** Smart Guardian Helmet: An Intelligent Safety System for Riders

**Real-life scenario**

The Smart Guardian Helmet is a system designed to improve rider safety and promote responsible driving behavior. The Smart Guardian Helmet enhances rider safety by integrating helmet detection, alcohol sensing, drowsiness monitoring and temperature alerts, ensuring the rider is fit to drive. With wireless data transmission, engine relay control, buzzer alerts and message display, it prevents unsafe riding conditions. Additional features like theft detection and auto light activation further promote security and visibility, making it a reliable companion for accident prevention and responsible driving.

**Features:

Helmet Detection:** Helmet must be worn to start the vehicle.

**Alcohol Detection:** Detects alcohol in rider’s breath and blocks ignition.

**Auto Light Activation:** Turns on lights in darkness for better visibility.

**Drowsiness Detection:** Monitors driver’s eye blink rate or head nodding.

**Message Showing:** Various types of message shown in the display.   	

**Theft detection:** When there is no data received from the transmitter, it means the helmet is too far from the two-wheeler. 

**Temperature & Weather Monitoring:** Warns if the environment is too hot.

**Buzzer Alerts: **Gives audible warnings for alcohol detection, drowsiness, overheating, or communication failure.

**Wireless Data Transmission:** Sends real-time helmet data (Helmet, Alcohol, Sleep, Temp) wirelessly to the bike system.

Engine Relay Control: Automatically controls ignition based on helmet wearing, alcohol level and drowsiness detection.
